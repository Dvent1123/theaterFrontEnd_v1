# Mock Movie Theater Website Front End

## About
This was an attempt to improve on an existing local movie theater website using css, javascript, and html. The website has multiple pages and even a login page. It was not attached to a backend at this point so no users could be saved and all the information was hard coded in. You can clone this repo and then use Live Server to serve the index.html file.
